For this a large number of sensors is included inside the generic product, as well as numerous external interfaces.</div><div><br></div><div>To make it even easier for customers to implement a new idea very fast these units can be configured completely using the Embedded Ant Graphical User Interface. This is a graphical tool that allows applications to be designed, simulated and tested on the unit itself without any programming knowledge. A normal configuration can be defined and tested in less than an hour even without pre-knowledge. Debugging includes receiving data from the SIGFOX backend when an internet connection is available. The tool also offers public and private repositories for sharing common implementations and examples.</div><div><br></div><div>The design is highly optimized on current consumption.

A beekeeper is therefore able to work from over 500 km away from his / her apiaries. Optibee is a strategic tool, which enables apiculturists to harvest at the right time or to treat urgent issues such as bringing supplies in case of famine. Knowing exactly when one needs to intervene on the hive enables the beekeeper to avoid unnecessary travel, thus reducing the environmental impact of the beekeeper. &nbsp;&nbsp;The social impact on the beekeeper is significant, as the constant data will result in reduced travel, and stress. The solution also offers opportunity for more teamwork, via sharing of information and data by beekeeper communities. Beekeepers using our solution reduce their travel costs by about 30% and productivity is greater as the beekeeper can better plan his/her work.

One of the most appreciated features of this Portal is the possibility to create different dashboards and to customize them through widgets like: Gauge, Gauges combination, Inclinometers, Line Charts, Histograms, Tables, Maps (to geolocalize sensor/daq system), Images (for example, a picture of the bridge with sensor's reading overlay where each sensor position is showed).</p>\n<p>Thanks to the use of <strong>NI203 SigFox Radio</strong>, the following results have been achieved;</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Use of Smart Sensors, “intelligent” devices always on and with wireless connection</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Short, ordered cables</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Unexpensive radio subscription</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>No radio infrastructure to be built, with better landscape impact and costs reduction</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Cloud/Personal server capabilities for easy data reading</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Long lasting batteries</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Wide choice of compatible sensors</strong> (4..20mA, Ratiometric, Vibrating Wire, 0-10V, NTC, TC, RS485 Modbus) that, becoming <strong>SMART</strong>, enable more accurate and automated collection of environmental data with less erroneous noise amongst the recorded information</li>\n  <li><strong>High resolution, accuracy and precision</strong> for more reliable measures</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Key top feature of this solution is the open possibility to use the same monitoring and control system in a wide variety of environments including smart water, environment, exploration and a great number of other science applications.</strong></p>","availability":"available","availabilityStandalone":true,"company":"5788a487a702c7430a395e08","shortDescription":"Primary function of the data acquisition and monitoring system is to ensure structure longevity, safety as well as timely focused intervention in case of damage.","sdk":false,"testMode":false,"videoLinks":[],"availableAt":"2017-01-13T13:48:22.681Z","createdAt":"2017-01-13T09:27:51.093Z","idKeySecured":false,"downlink":false,"flashableFirmware":false,"publishedAt":"2017-01-13T13:48:22.699Z","slug":"bridge-monitoring-with-miniomnialog-sigfox-radio","embeddedProductIds":["578cdc05316f1f590a1615a7","585904f9fd068e37628b4277"],"categories":"solution","availabilityDetails":[{"q":10,"a":30}],"replacementProduct":null},{"_id":"5878bb899ec1d1379c3a66bc","buyLink":"","certificationClass":0,"deviceZones":["zone1"],"link":"","certificationNumber":"P_004A_D565_01","name":"Everysens Sensors","marketVerticals":[],"batteryType":"replaceable","businessZones":[],"sensitivity":0,"customisable":false,"certified":2,"memorySizeFirmware":0,"status":0,"order":0,"selectivity":0,"maxRadiatedPower":0,"provideSample":false,"updatedAt":"2017-01-13T13:49:15.526Z","description":"<ul>\n  <li>Customizable &amp; flexible : <em>Embedded Software Fit for your industry</em></li>\n  <li>Industry specific sensors : <em>Various sizes</em></li>\n  <li>High reliability : <em>96% even when assets are moving &amp; when no Sigfox coverage</em></li>\n  <li>Easy to install : <em>Intallation time : 15 min.</em></li>\n  <li>High autonomy : <em>Certification for highly deployement</em></li>\n</ul>","weight":170,"availability":"available","availabilityStandalone":false,"certificationMark":["ce"],"company":"578370240a81902d3a8d6df6","shortDescription":"Industrial Grade Autonomous Sensors","sdk":false,"testMode":false,"videoLinks":[],"availableAt":"2017-01-13T13:49:15.512Z","createdAt":"2017-01-13T11:35:37.515Z","batteryLife":"5y","downlink":false,"flashableFirmware":false,"dimensions":"4x6x10","slug":"everysens-sensors","sensors":[],"idKeySecured":false,"publishedAt":"2017-01-13T13:49:15.526Z","categories":"device"},{"_id":"585904f9fd068e37628b4277","buyLink":"","certificationClass":3,"link":"http://www.nextind.eu/en/work/item/419-cloud-overview.html","businessZones":[],"name":"Next Industries Cloud Platform","marketVerticals":["anything"],"customisable":false,"sensitivity":0,"memorySizeFirmware":0,"certified":0,"status":0,"order":0,"selectivity":0,"maxRadiatedPower":0,"provideSample":false,"updatedAt":"2017-01-13T14:20:00.810Z","description":"<p>Connection of your devices to our Cloud Platform is fast and easy.
